# My_SocialNetwork_API_App

#Description

NoSQL: Social Network API

The purpose of this application was to understand how to use routes and controllers to work with the database. Based on the route the user can update, delete, add, update, get a single user, single thought, add/remove friends or reactions, etc.
The information from the databse working with mongoose will portray the changes to the data from the routes and functions from the controllers.
I'm still working on this application currently.

#Usage

For future development other types of data and models can be added to create more complex routes to work withg the data base such as blogs, movies, hobbies, etc.
This can be used on a bigger scale for company apps such as an employee tracker app, company inventory, ecommerce market,etc.
